# Food-Delivey

Here’s a concise English introduction for the Food Delivery project:

> The Food Delivery System is a C++-based, end-to-end platform that manages customers, restaurants, drivers, and orders through a set of well-encapsulated classes. Employing the Singleton pattern for a single, centralized controller, it validates all inputs, tracks each order’s status from placement to delivery, and assigns drivers dynamically. Designed for clarity and maintainability, it ensures data integrity and provides a clear workflow for processing and monitoring food deliveries.&#x20;
